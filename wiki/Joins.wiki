Whenever an arc token arrives at a node, a decision must be made as to what to do. There are three options to select from.

  # The conditions for executing the node have not been met. The arc token will remain in an incomplete state. The arc token will await some point in the future, when another arc token may arrive that causes the node execution criteria to be met.
  # The conditions for executing the node may be met. All the arc tokens that contributed to this will be become the parents of the new node token.
